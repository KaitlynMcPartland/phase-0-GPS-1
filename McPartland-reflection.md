GPS 1.1
--------

#####What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Before the GPS session I had never seen a merge conflict before and wasn't clear on what the workflow to resolve them was.

#####What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I definately have a better understanding of how to handle merge conflicts. I would benefit from a little more practice to feel truely comfortable but I know enough now to work on it on my own.

I also learned some new things about branching, I didn't realize that when you made a new branch it branches off of whatever branch you have checked out (I assumed they all came from the master).

#####What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my guide/pair (they were the same person) to clarify the differences between git fetch, git merge, and git pull. I now understand that git fetch used with git merge can be equal to using git pull.

#####What still confuses you about Git?
There is nothing specific that I am confused about. I think that I need to practice resolving merge conflicts again but overall I feel pretty comfortable with Git at the moment.

#####How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I had a great first GPS exerience. There was not another student so my guide, Sara, was my pair. I was pleasantly surprised that she was my partner, I felt a little less nervous pairing with her than I would have been with another student. Being the navigator felt a little weird, I felt like I was being a little bit bossy by giving the driver so many directions but Sara said I was doing well. It is just something I will have to get used to and I can work on giving direction while still collaborating with the driver.
